# T4BuildTasks #

## Description ##

The Text Template Transformation Toolkit (T4) is a powerful tool, but has to be run manually. This project produces a NuGet package which contains the files (a couple DLLs and a .targets file) necessary to perform T4 tasks during a build.

**UNOFFICIAL**: This project is not produced by the T4 team. If you think this is useful, please encourage them to produce an official NuGet package.
