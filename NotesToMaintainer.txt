Greetings gentle Maintainer.

(Oh, it's you again--you've forgotten everything about this since you hacked on
it last year, didn't you?)

You can build the package by running make.ps1 in this same directory.

Requirements to build:
  * NuGet.exe must be on your path.

When you run make.ps1, NuGet.exe will use the content in the .\Package
directory and the .nuspec file in this directory to build a .nupkg file (which
is really just a .zip file with a particular layout). You can find the
generated package in the .\Output directory, which you can then copy to or
upload to a gallery.

Updating:

When VS vNext comes out, you will probably need to update the T4 binaries. You
should be able to get them by installing the "Visual Studio Modeling SDK" (or
"Visualization and Modeling" SDK). Or maybe they'll have changed the name by
then. Anyway, get the new files, and then change the version number in the
.nuspec file accordingly.

Oh, and you'll also need to rename the .targets file to T4BuildTasks.targets,
because that's how NuGet likes it (it wants it to match the package name).

Happy hacking.
